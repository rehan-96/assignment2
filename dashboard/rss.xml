      <title>Two well-known neurochemicals found to be involved in sub-second perception, cognition</title>
      <description>In first-of-their-kind observations in the human brain, an international team of researchers has revealed two well-known neurochemicals -; dopamine and serotonin -; are at work at sub-second speeds to shape how people perceive the world and take action based on their perception.</description>

      <title>Stud shows possibility for regenerating neurons in the eye and brain</title>
      <description>The death of neurons, whether in the brain or the eye, can result in a number of human neurodegenerative disorders, from blindness to Parkinson's disease. Current treatments for these disorders can only slow the progression of the illness, because once a neuron dies, it cannot be replaced.</description>

      <title>Spinal cord stimulation improves pain and motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease</title>
      <description>A team of researchers in the United States and Japan reports that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) measurably decreased pain and reduced motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, both as a singular therapy and as a "salvage therapy" after deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies were ineffective.</description>
